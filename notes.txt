To delete your last commit in Git, use git reset HEAD~1 to undo the 
commit but keep changes, or git reset --hard HEAD~1 to delete the 
commit and all its changes (local only); for pushed commits,
use the safer git revert HEAD or git reset --hard HEAD~1 followed 
by git push --force (use with caution).
